## Installing Marmara Credit Loops from Pre-compiled Binaries

One can download and unzip our pre-compiled binaries. This is the simplest method and hence requires no compiling procedure.

## Linux 

Verify that your system is up to date.

```	
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade -y
```

#### Install the dependency packages

```	
sudo apt-get install libgomp1
```
#### Downloading Assets from Releases
Go to [Releases](https://github.com/marmarachain/marmara/releases) and download Marmara linux binaries .zip from Assets and follow the instructions given below.

> Make sure to follow the following instructions on the downloaded directory or any other directory where you moved or copied. 

```sh
sudo apt install unzip
unzip MCL-linux.zip
sudo chmod +x komodod komodo-cli fetch-params.sh
./fetch-params.sh
```
#### Start and Run the Marmara Chain

To start the chain, open the command prompt and execute the following sets of commands:
```
./komodod -ac_name=MCL -ac_supply=2000000 -ac_cc=2 -addnode=37.148.210.158 -addnode=37.148.212.36 -addnode=149.202.158.145 -addressindex=1 -spentindex=1 -ac_marmara=1 -ac_staked=75 -ac_reward=3000000000
```
To stop the chain:
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=MCL stop
```

#### Backup Your Wallet

Backing up the `wallet.dat` file is very essential as it holds the assets of one.
On a Linux machine, the file could be found in: `~/.komodo/MCL/wallet.dat`

One method to backup this file is to archive a copy of the file.

```bash
#Copy the wallet.dat file
cp -av ~/.komodo/MCL/wallet.dat ~/wallet.dat

#Rename the wallet.dat file
mv ~/wallet.dat ~/2020-08-09-wallet_backup.dat

# Make an archieve of the wallet.dat file
tar -czvf ~/2020-08-09-wallet_backup.dat.tgz ~/2020-08-09-wallet_backup.dat

# Move the final file to a secure location
```

### Enabling UFW
This step is not required for installing MCL but can be used for server security purposes.

- Check the status of UFW by
```
sudo ufw status
```
- UFW package can be installed by executing the following command
```	
sudo apt install ufw
```
- Activate UFW and allow connections by executing the following commands
```
echo y | sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw allow ssh
sudo ufw allow "OpenSSH"
sudo ufw allow 33824
sudo ufw allow out 33824
```

## MacOS

Issue the following command in a terminal to install the command line tools:

```
xcode-select –install
```

Download the .zip file from Releases page under Assets [here](https://github.com/marmarachain/marmara/releases/) to your macOS machine and extract the files. Change directory to the location of komodod & komodo-cli on the terminal. 

Run the following command:  

```sh
./fetch-params.sh
```

#### Start and Run the Marmara Chain

To start the chain, open the command prompt and execute the following sets of commands:
```
cd Desktop\MCL\
komodod.exe -ac_name=MCL -ac_supply=2000000 -ac_cc=2 -addnode=37.148.210.158 -addnode=37.148.212.36 -addnode=149.202.158.145 -addressindex=1 -spentindex=1 -ac_marmara=1 -ac_staked=75 -ac_reward=3000000000
